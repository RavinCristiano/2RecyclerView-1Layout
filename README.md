You can create 2 RecyclerView with CardView using Text and Images.
1st RecyclerView will work Horizontal and 2nd RecyclerView will work Vertical.
No need to use heavy Layouts, Scrollviews, LinearLayout etc.
You can just use Single Relative Layout for both RecyclerView.
You can Add any TextViews, SearchBar or more components according to your requirements.
